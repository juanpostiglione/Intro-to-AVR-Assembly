# Intro-to-AVR-Assembly

Introduction

This project explores AVR assembly programming using the ATxmega128A1U microcontroller. It involves reading data from program memory, applying bitwise operations and conditional logic, and storing the processed results in data memory. The lab provides hands-on experience with low-level programming, register manipulation, and memory management.

Purpose and Applications
	•	Microcontroller Programming: Understanding how to work with assembly instructions, registers, and memory operations.
	•	Embedded Systems: Learning efficient data handling techniques for low-power, resource-constrained devices.
	•	Bitwise Operations & Data Processing: Implementing arithmetic shifts, conditional modifications, and table lookups.
	•	Real-World Applications: This knowledge is essential for firmware development, hardware control, and signal processing in embedded systems.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced microcontroller-based applications involving interrupts, peripherals, and real-time processing.
